# Optional "docs" target that regenerates the html documentation in docs/html
# from the engine headers and the guide pages. Only appears when doxygen is
# installed. The generated html is not committed; read the published docs at
# https://dyronix.github.io/buz-engine/ or build them here to preview
# locally.
